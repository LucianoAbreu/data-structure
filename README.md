# Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository is a personal project to review and practice **classic data structures and algorithms**.  
The main focus is to implement everything **from scratch in JavaScript**, avoiding built-in helper methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, etc.) to strengthen problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## 🎯 Goals

- Revisit and implement fundamental **data structures** (Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- Implement common **algorithms** (search, sorting, traversal, recursion).
- Understand how nodes, pointers, and memory references work in practice.
- Improve algorithmic reasoning by manually coding operations step by step.
- Practice clean and consistent JavaScript code.

## 📂 Contents

- **Stack & Dinamic Stack** → push, pop, peek.
- **Simple Queue & Dinamic Simple Queue** → enqueue, dequeue, peek.
- **Circular Queue** → enqueue, dequeue, peek.
- **Singly Linked List** → append, prepend, removeFirst, removeAt, reverse, etc.
- _More structures will be added as the review goes on._

## 🚀 Why JavaScript?

Although data structures are often studied in C++ or Java, implementing them in JavaScript is fun!

## 🛠️ How to Run

Clone this repository and run any of the `.js` files with Node.js:

```bash
node stack.js
```
